## Introduction

This project aims to answer several key questions regarding the trends and relationships between GDP and life expectancy:

- Has life expectancy increased over time in the nine nations?
- Has GDP increased over time in the nine nations?
- Is there a correlation between GDP and life expectancy of a country?
- What is the average life expectancy in these nations?
- What is the distribution of that life expectancy?

## Data

The dataset used in this analysis includes GDP and life expectancy data for nine countries from 1990 to 2020. It contains 279 rows and 4 columns:

- **Country**: The name of the country
- **Year**: The year of the data point
- **LEB**: Life Expectancy at Birth (years)
- **GDP**: Gross Domestic Product (in billions)

## Visualizations

The project includes the following visualizations:

1. **Life Expectancy Over Time**: Line plots showing the trend of life expectancy for each country.
2. **GDP Over Time**: Line plots showing the trend of GDP for each country.
3. **Correlation Between GDP and Life Expectancy**: Scatter plot with regression line to show the correlation.
4. **Average Life Expectancy**: Bar plot showing the average life expectancy for each country.
5. **Distribution of Life Expectancy**: Histogram showing the distribution of life expectancy values.
6. **Distribution of GDP**: Histogram showing the distribution of GDP values.

## Analysis

### Key Findings:

- **Life Expectancy**: Life expectancy has generally increased over time across the nine nations, with Japan having the highest and Chad the lowest.
- **GDP**: GDP has also increased for all countries, with significant growth in China and the United States.
- **Correlation**: There is a positive correlation between GDP and life expectancy, indicating that economic prosperity is linked to better health outcomes.
- **Average Life Expectancy**: Japan has the highest average life expectancy, while Chad has the lowest.
- **Distributions**: The distributions of both life expectancy and GDP are skewed, with life expectancy skewed right and GDP showing a power law distribution.

## Conclusion

This project was able to create several insightful data visualizations with a relatively small dataset, effectively highlighting trends and relationships between GDP and life expectancy across nine nations. The analysis provides valuable insights into the impact of economic development on health outcomes.

## Further Research

Future research could explore:

- Extended time series analysis including more recent data.
- The impact of regional and cultural factors on life expectancy and GDP.
- The role of healthcare expenditure.
- The effect of income inequality.
- The influence of education and employment rates.
- Policy implications for enhancing economic and health outcomes.
